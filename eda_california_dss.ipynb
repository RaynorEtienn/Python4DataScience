    "In our dataset, it seems that because White not Hispanic individuals are older than Hispanic ones, and that age seems to lead to more expenditures, it may look like being White not Hispanic instead of Hispanic leads to more expenditures (while the true discrimination seems to be based on the age and not the ethnicity itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you were doing a regression in order to predict the expenditures, then you must have the age (or age cohort) feature in your model.\n",

    "Hence, as Data Scientists, it is always insightful to perform an EDA as a first step when receiving a data set, to understand your data better, thus model it better. You would need to discuss your observations with domain experts.\n",

    ">`ydata-profiling` (previously called `pandas-profiling`) generates profile reports from a pandas `DataFrame`. The pandas `df.describe()` function is handy yet a little basic for exploratory data analysis. `ydata-profiling` extends pandas `DataFrame` with `df.profile_report()`, which automatically generates a standardized univariate and multivariate report for data understanding."
